My custom i3 setup

What it looks like:

Many of the blocklets are clickable. Middle clicking on the VPN blocklet will enable/disable my vpn, the volume and screen brightness blocklets react to mouse scrolling. My keyboard switcher cycles between dvorak/dvorak-intl with left clicks, and qwerty/dvorak with right clicks.

Most of the blocklet scripts use hardcoded values, edit accordingly.

Terminal is urxvt with included .Xresources
